# Cadets Against Humanity!

A 2-day group project developed over the weekend.
Our idea was to recreate the popular card game "Cards Against Humanity" (and make it playable in the terminal), which is, a famous party icebreaker, adults-only game for players mature enough to handle the intentionally provocative (but often hilarious) topics and answers. The goal is to pair the answer and question cards in the funniest, most provocative, or the cleverest way you can.

## The Development

Having a narrow deadline to finish the project, we tried to focus our attention on the minimum viable product. That includes having the server broadcasting messages to all the players in it, asking them to choose a card, displaying the back card and all the white cards played in that round and tell you the winner of the round. At last, it shows the winner after 8 rounds. And then it begins a new game. And we finished it. We implemented everything we wanted. The whole process was smooth and the result was much better than we ever dreamed of.

## My Role

Since I came up with the idea for the project I was the appointed Kanban master. I had to keep the tasks organized so the project would run smoothly, as it did. In the development, I had first touches in populating the card decks and helped all along with the transition to the server.

## Tech && Methodologies used

Java, IntelliJ, Linux, Mac OS, Google Slides, Prompt-View Library, Maven, Git, Kanban.
